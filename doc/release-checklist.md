# Release checklist

## Version bump

- [ ] Update version in `Cargo.toml`. Run `cargo build` to update `Cargo.lock`.
      Make sure to `git add` the `Cargo.lock` changes as well.
- [ ] Find the current min. supported Rust version by running
      `cargo metadata --no-deps --format-version 1 | jq -r '.packages[0].rust_version'`.
- [ ] Update the version and the min. supported Rust version in `README.md` and
      `doc/README-*.md`. Check with
      `git grep -i -e 'rust.*1\.' -e '1\..*rust' | grep README | grep -v tests/`.

## CHANGELOG.md updates

- [ ] Compare current `CHANGELOG.md` against
  `tag=$(git tag --sort=-creatordate | grep ^v | head -n1) ; git diff $tag` and add
  missing entries. Expect in particular dependabot PRs to not be in
  `CHANGELOG.md` since they are [auto-merged] if CI passes.
- [ ] Introduce a section for the new release and perform final touch-ups.
  The GitHub Release notes will be taken from `CHANGELOG.md` with the
  `parse-changelog` crate.

## Update syntaxes and themes (build assets)

- [ ] Install the latest master version (`cargo clean && cargo install --locked -f --path .`) and make
      sure that it is available on the `PATH` (`bat --version` should show the
      new version).
- [ ] Run `assets/create.sh` and check in the binary asset files.

## Documentation

- [ ] Review [`-h`](./short-help.txt), [`--help`](./long-help.txt), and the `man` page. The `man` page is shown in
      the output of the CI job called *Documentation*, so look there.
      The CI workflow corresponding to the tip of the master branch is a good place to look.

## Pre-release checks

- [ ] Push all changes and wait for CI to succeed (before continuing with the
      next section).
- [ ] Optional: manually test the new features and command-line options. To do
      this, install the latest `bat` version again (to include the new syntaxes
      and themes).
- [ ] Run `cargo publish --dry-run` to make sure that it will
      succeed later.

## Release

1. Run https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/actions/workflows/Release.yml workflow from `main` ([instructions](#how-to-trigger-main-branch-workflow))
1. Done!

TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO 
HOW TO FIX? Parameterize IS_RELEASE on CICD.yml and set from calling workflow?
- [ ] Check if the binary deployment works (archives and Debian packages should
      appear when the CI run for the Git tag has finished).

## Post-release

      Put this at the top:

```
